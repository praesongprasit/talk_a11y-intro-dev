						<p>Hi everyone!</p>
						<p>Today I'll to give you a quick intro to accessibility</p>
						<p>I'm going to explain what it is, who it's for, and why it's important for both you and your audience/users</p>
						<p>Fun fact: a11y is an inaccessible abbreviation of the word accessibility, because there are 11 letters between a &amp; y</p>

						<p>First, a little bit about me</p>
						<p>I'm a UX engineer. That's what we call developers who specialises in coding up designs into something that a user can interact with.</p>
						<p>I'm working at Xero. But I've previously worked on projects with ANZ bank, and newzealand.com</p>
						<p>I'm especially good with accessibility and design systems</p>

					<img

					/>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I love <a href="https://digital.govt.nz">https://digital.govt.nz</a>‘s explanation:</p>
						<blockquote>Web accessibility is about inclusion — making sure everyone, including disabled people and those using assistive technologies, can access online information and services.</blockquote>

				<section aria-labelledby="slide3">
					<h2 id="slide3">What is<br>web accessibility?</h2>
					
					<p>
						Inclusion and access to <br><strong>information</strong> 
						and <strong>services</strong>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So what this is saying, people need to be able to access and use the web.</p>
						<p>Why is it important that everyone have access? Because</p>
						<p><strong>Information</strong> leads to knowledge. Knowledge <strong>empowers</strong> people</p>
						<p>A person who can't read very well can still learn about a their rights, if you've used simple language, or provide audio alternative.</p>
						<p>What about <strong>services</strong>? Services <strong>enable users</strong> to achieve their goal</p>
						<p>Someone who can't speak will struggle to call a call center. But if service is also available online, they can use online form to use the service.</p>

					<h2 id="slide4">Who is web accessibility for?</h2>
					
					<p span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						❤️  Everyone
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So based on what I've just said, you can guess that answer.</p>
						<p>It is for <strong>everyone</strong></p>
						<p>By designing & developing a disability friendly experience, you can often benefit wider ranging audience than you think.</p>
					</aside>

					<h2 id="slide5">Types of disabilities</h2>
					
					<img class="stretch"
							src="img/ms_persona-spectrum.png"
							alt="Micrsoft inclusive design personal spectrum, showing how different types of physical disabilities can be caused permanently, temporarily, and situationally.">

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Microsoft's inclusive design guideline illustrated this persona spectrum wonderfully.</p>
						<p>On top of different types of physical disabilities, situation that cause those disabilities differ.</p>
						<p>This really drive home the point, that if you design for perment disabilities, lots more people can benefit.</p>
						<p>We usually think of blind people, extreme, but it can just be borg (hungover).</p>

					<h2 id="slide6">The curb cut effect</h2>
					
					<img

						src="img/sketchplanations_curb-cut-effect.png"
						alt="A sketch of stick figers using wheel chair curb cuts in different ways, like someone with a stroller, bycicle, and wheeling a fork lift." 
					/>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This is what we called, a curb cut effect.</p>
						<p>Curb cuts, were initially designed for wheel chair users to safely get off the footpath, and cross the street.</p>
						<p>But when people were asked what they think the curb cut was for, cyclists thought it's for them. Parents with strollers thought it's for them. Same as the delivery person.</p>
						<p>Many groups benefit from things being designed for ease of access.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>So not only it's a morally right thing to do</p>
						<p>You cover a way larger part of the population than you think!</p>
						<p>It also produce genuinely good experiences. Accessible products feels good.</p>
						<p>It's demonstrating benefits of universal design at its best!</p>

					<h2 id="slide9">Develop an accessible experience</h2>
					<p>Where to start?</p>
				</section>


				<section aria-labelledby="slide10">
					<h3 id="slide10">Try keyboard only</h3>
					<p>
						Can you navigate your website with only keyboard?
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>You'll quickly learn to use tab and arrow keys to swiftly move around the app</p>
						<p>If there are some parts that you cannot get to with keyboard, it's not accessible</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section aria-labelledby="slide11">
					<h3 id="slide10">Test with styles turned off</h3>
					<p>
						❤️ by keyboard only users, <br>screen readers, <br>people with different cognitive abilities
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When you start with visuals, it's easy to focus on the layout, the colours, the typography, the imagery, and other visual cues to hint at actions users can take. It's fun!</p>
						<p>But often, it's very hard to translate the 'feel' of colours and typography to access needs users, using assitive tools.</p>
						<p>As a sighted user, I can quickly scan the visuals to understand what your product and services is about.</p>
						<p>Screen reader users and keyboard users cannot take so much information all at once. Their tool only let them interact with your product one text or input at a time. So think about your user flow, and make sure to design that order explicitly and clearly. Don't make people jump around your page.</p>
						<p>Try turning all the styles off. Does your app still make sense if you read it? If the order is weird, it'll be weird for assistive tech users</p>
						<p>Use keyboard to tab through </p>

					<h3 id="slide11">Apply recommended practices</h3>
					<p>
						Use linter to enforce those HTML and framework practices!
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>In the past, I used to recommend people learning HTML basics... but no one would now. They all use frameworks</p>
						<p>Reputable frameworks like React, Flutter, and etc. are getting better at enforcing some of the practices that makes sites more accessible.</p>

				<section aria-labelledby="slide13">
					<h2 id="slide13">Accessibility is a right</h2>
					<p>
						to <em>equal access</em> of <em>your</em> information and services</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I'm speaking to the you developers, who will go out there and create useful experiences for lots of people.</p>
						<p>I want us all to remember, that accessibility is a right</p>
						<p>When us creators make things without ease of access in mind, we DISABLE people. We take away their rights.</p>
						<p>People can be disabled in many ways, be it permanently, temporarily, and situationally.</p>
						<p>We can help prevent that, by creating clear linear text experience, and provide multiple ways to access products and services.</p>
						<p>By creating accessible designs, your design will become more valuable and usable by more people.</p>
