						<p>Hi everyone!</p>
						<p>Today I'll to give you a quick intro to accessibility</p>
						<p>I'm going to explain what it is, who it's for, and why it's important for both you and your audience/users</p>
						<p>Fun fact: a11y is an inaccessible abbreviation of the word accessibility, because there are 11 letters between a &amp; y</p>

						<p>First, a little bit about me</p>
						<p>I'm a UX engineer. That's what we call developers who specialises in coding up your beautiful designs into something that a user can interact with.</p>
						<p>I'm working at Xero. But I've previously worked on projects with ANZ bank, and newzealand.com</p>
						<p>I'm especially good with accessibility and design systems</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I love <a href="https://digital.govt.nz">https://digital.govt.nz</a>‘s explanation:</p>
						<blockquote>Web accessibility is about inclusion — making sure everyone, including disabled people and those using assistive technologies, can access online information and services.</blockquote>

					<h2 id="slide3">What is<br>web accessibility?</h2>
					
					<p>
						Inclusion and access to <br><strong>information</strong> 
						and <strong>services</strong>
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So what this is saying, people need to be able to access and use the web.</p>
						<p>Why is it important that everyone have access? Because</p>
						<p><strong>Information</strong> leads to knowledge. Knowledge <strong>empowers</strong> people</p>
						<p>A person who can't read very well can still learn about a their rights, if you've used simple language, or provide audio alternative.</p>
						<p>What about <strong>services</strong>? Services <strong>enable users</strong> to achieve their goal</p>
						<p>Someone who can't speak will struggle to call a call center. But if service is also available online, they can use online form to use the service.</p>

					<h2 id="slide4">Who is web accessibility for?</h2>
					
					<p span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						❤️  Everyone
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>So based on what I've just said, you can guess that answer.</p>
						<p>It is for <strong>everyone</strong></p>
						<p>By designing a disability friendly experience, you can often benefit wider ranging audience than you think.</p>

					<img class="stretch"

							alt="Micrsoft inclusive design personal spectrum, showing how different types of physical disabilities can be caused permanently, temporarily, and situationally.">

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Microsoft's inclusive design guideline illustrated this persona spectrum wonderfully.</p>
						<p>On top of different types of physical disabilities, situation that cause those disabilities differ.</p>
						<p>This really drive home the point, that if you design for perment disabilities, lots more people can benefit.</p>
						<p>We usually think of blind people, extreme, but it can just be borg (hungover).</p>

						src="img/sketchplanations_curb-cut-effect.png"
						alt="A sketch of stick figers using wheel chair curb cuts in different ways, like someone with a stroller, bycicle, and wheeling a fork lift." 
					/>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>This is what we called, a curb cut effect.</p>
						<p>Curb cuts, were initially designed for wheel chair users to safely get off the footpath, and cross the street.</p>
						<p>But when people were asked what they think the curb cut was for, cyclists thought it's for them. Parents with strollers thought it's for them. Same as the delivery person.</p>
						<p>Many groups benefit from things being designed for ease of access.</p>
						<hr>
						<p>So not only it's a morally right thing to do</p>
						<p>You cover a way larger part of the population than you think!</p>
						<p>It also produce genuinely good design. Accessible design feels good.</p>
						<p>It's demonstrating benefits of universal design at its best!</p>

					<h2 id="slide9">How to design<br>an accessible experience?</h2>
					<p>
						Start with content, not visuals
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>You may have been sick of the 'content is king' saying</p>
						<p>There's no truer saying in the field of accessibility</p>
						<p>What are the users actually on your web product for?</p>
						<p>It's information and services. Visuals is a secondary way to deliver that information</p>
						<p>When I work with a designer who starts imagining a flow in pure text experience first, 70-80% of the accessibility problems will be resolved at the design phase.</p>
						<p>Then it is up to UX engineers like me to drive the rest home, using the most semantic HTML code possible</p>

				<section aria-labelledby="slide10">
					<h3 id="slide10">Linear text experience</h3>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						❤️ by keyboard only users, <br>screen readers, <br>people with different cognitive abilities
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>When you start with visuals, it's easy to focus on the layout, the colours, the typography, the imagery, and other visual cues to hint at actions users can take. It's fun!</p>
						<p>But often, it's very hard to translate the 'feel' of colours and typography to access needs users, using assitive tools.</p>
						<p>As a sighted user, I can quickly scan the visuals to understand what your product and services is about.</p>
						<p>Screen reader users and keyboard users cannot take so much information all at once. Their tool only let them interact with your product one text or input at a time. So think about your user flow, and make sure to design that order explicitly and clearly. Don't make people jump around your page.</p>
						<p>The best designers and designs I've ever worked with, start from a linear text experience, which can be easily understood what read out loud.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section aria-labelledby="slide11">
					<h3 id="slide11">Multiple ways to convey information</h3>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						Text, video, audio, non-coloured visual treatments
					</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Another thing to do is to provide multiple ways to convey information</p>
						<p>When displaying images, think of how you want to explain that image to a friend over the phone. That's the text developers need from you to implement as an alt text.</p>
						<p>When posting a video, enable closed caption and or audio description for those who cannot hear, is working in a loud area without a headphone.</p>
						<p>When creating a podcast, provide transcript of the conversation. As a bonus, that is also good for SEO/google search!</p>
						<p>When showing errors, make sure to use other visual cues that this is an error, not just colours, because colourblind users will not see those colours.</p>

				<section aria-labelledby="slide12">
					<h3 id="slide12">Overwhelmed?</h3>

					<h2 id="slide13">Accessibility is a right</h2>
					<p class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">
						to <em>equal access</em> of <em>your</em> information and services</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I'm speaking to the future designers, who will go out there and create useful experiences for lots of people.</p>
						<p>I want us all to remember, that accessibility is a right</p>
						<p>When us creators design things without ease of access in mind, we DISABLE people. We take away their rights.</p>
						<p>People can be disabled in many ways, be it permanently, temporarily, and situationally.</p>
						<p>We can help prevent that, by creating clear linear text experience, and provide multiple ways to access products and services.</p>
						<p>By creating accessible designs, your design will become more valuable and usable by more people.</p>
